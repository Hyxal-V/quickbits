![](https://browserstack.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/test-automation-pyramid-700x641.jpg)

| Layer                 | Tests                                      | Fast?         | Reliable?       | Cost        | Purpose                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| üß™ Unit Tests         | Test single functions/methods              | ‚ö° Super fast  | ‚úÖ Very reliable | üí∏ Cheap    | Test internal logic          |
| üîå Integration Tests  | Test interactions between modules (e.g., DB + API) | ‚ö° Fast-ish    | ‚úÖ Reliable      | üí∏ Medium   | Check systems work together |
| üßç End-to-End (E2E) Tests | Test whole user flows (e.g., login)     | üê¢ Slow        | ‚ùå Often flaky    | üí∏üí∏ Expensive | Mimic real user behavior     |


### Unit Testing 
Unit testing is the process of testing the smallest testable parts of an application (called units, like functions, methods, or classes) in isolation to ensure they behave correctly.
- Focues on one thing at a time
- Doesnt test external systems (eg database,file system)
- Should be automated and repeatable


 
#### Core concepts:-

| Term	| What it does|
|---|---|
| **Test Case**| A single scenario that tests a specific behaviour|
|**Assertion**	|Statement that checks if a value meets expectations
**Test suite**	| A collection of test cases
**Mocking** |Replacing real dependencies with fake ones |
**Test Coverage**|How much of your code is exercised by tests

### Code Coverage
Code coverage is a metric that tells you what percentage of your code is executed when your tests run. It helps answer:

|**Term**|**What it Measures**|**Example**
|---|----|---|
| **Line Coverage**   | Which lines were executed              | `if (x > 0)` ‚Äî was this line run?        |
| **Branch Coverage** | Whether every branch (if/else) executed| Did both `if` **and** `else` paths run?  |
| **Function Coverage**| Which functions/methods were called  | Was `calculateTax()` called at all?      |
| **Statement Coverage**| Similar to line coverage             |                                          |
| **Condition Coverage**| All boolean conditions tested        | `if (a && b)` ‚Äî were both `a` and `b` true/false? |

- 70‚Äì90% is considered healthy
- Focus more on meaningful coverage rather than number-chasing
- **100% is not always realistic ‚Äî some code (e.g. error logs, debug-only paths) isn't worth testing**

## Modified Condition/Decision Coverage
In software development, MC/DC is a testing metric that ensures your conditional logic is thoroughly tested. It‚Äôs used especially when:

- You work with complex if, while, or switch conditions

- You build software that must be highly reliable

- You want to ensure that each part of a decision is meaningful and tested

MC/DC helps you:

- Avoid logic bugs that slip past simple tests

- Catch missing test cases early

- Justify test coverage to stakeholders or auditors

- Make your code robust in the face of change

## üíª Example

```javascript
function isTransactionAllowed(user, amount) {
  return user.isActive && !user.isFrozen && amount < user.limit;
}
```
Conditions:

- user.isActive

- !user.isFrozen

- amount < user.limit


To satisfy MC/DC:
Write test cases where each condition is flipped independently and causes the decision to change:

Active, not frozen, within limit ‚Üí ‚úÖ

Active, not frozen, over limit ‚Üí ‚ùå

Inactive, not frozen, within limit ‚Üí ‚ùå

Active, frozen, within limit ‚Üí ‚ùå



#### Applying MC/DC in Development
 When Writing Code:
- Break large expressions into smaller parts

- Avoid deep nesting of logic

When Writing Tests:
- Use truth tables

- Focus on minimal MC/DC test sets

| Test Case | A (isActive) | B (!isFrozen) | C (amount < limit) | Result |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| TC1       | false        | true          | true                | false  |
| TC2       | true         | true          | true                | true   |
| TC3       | true         | false         | true                | false  |
| TC4       | true         | true          | false               | false  |

##  When to Use MC/DC

| Use MC/DC when...                          | Don't worry about MC/DC when...         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Complex or safety-critical decision logic | Simple CRUD or prototype apps            |
| High-stakes business or compliance code   | Non-critical tooling                     |
| Refactoring complex boolean logic         | Iterating quickly on internal apps       |
| Formal QA or coverage requirement         | Small scripts or UI tweaks               |

### Integration Testing

Integration Testing verifies that multiple components/modules of a system work together as expected.

### What Does It Test?
You‚Äôre testing the interaction between two or more units, such as:

- API route ‚Üî Controller ‚Üî Service ‚Üî Database

- Microservice A ‚Üî Microservice B

- Backend ‚Üî Cache (Redis) ‚Üî Queue

- Module A ‚Üî External API
### Key Goals
- Detect interface mismatches

- Ensure data flow and transformations work properly

- Catch real-world issues like DB failures, unexpected responses, timeouts
### üß™ What to Test in Integration Tests?

| Scenario             | Example                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DB interaction        | Does `POST /signup` store data in the database?         |
| Auth flows            | Does login return a JWT if credentials are valid?       |
| Service connections   | Does the backend store uploaded file to S3 correctly?   |
| Inter-service calls   | Does Service A call Service B and handle the response?  |
| State transitions     | Does the cart update correctly after checkout?          |

### Patterns of Integration Testing
1. Big Bang Integration
    - Combine all components and test everything together

    - Bad for isolating errors

2. Top-Down Integration
    -   Start with high-level modules, mock lower ones (use stubs)

3. Bottom-Up Integration
    - Start with low-level modules (e.g., DB), mock top layers (drivers)

4. Sandwich (Hybrid)
    - Combine both approaches; test middle layer first

### Real-Life Example
Flow:
```nginx
Request ‚Üí Express Route ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí MongoDB
```
Test Code:
```js
// user.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app'); // Express app
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

beforeAll(async () => {
  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/testdb');
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await mongoose.connection.dropDatabase();
  await mongoose.connection.close();
});

describe('POST /users', () => {
  it('should create a user', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/users')
      .send({ name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });

    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(201);
    expect(res.body.user.email).toBe('john@example.com');
  });
});

```
### Test Data Management
Integration tests touch real DBs. You must:

- Seed test data before tests

- Rollback or clean DB after tests

- Use Dockerized DBs or tools like Testcontainers

- Optionally use in-memory DBs like SQLite or Redis Memory

### Dealing with External Services
Options:

1. Use mocks/fakes ‚Äì simulate APIs, queues, etc.

2. Use test instances ‚Äì e.g., test S3 bucket

3. Use Docker/Testcontainers ‚Äì spin up actual Redis, DB, etc.

### When to Write Integration Tests?

‚úÖ Do write when:

- Your app calls another module, DB, or service
- Data is being passed/converted across boundaries
- A bug could come from incorrect connections

‚ùå Don‚Äôt write when:
- You're just testing a function (sum(a, b))
 
- You‚Äôve already tested it fully in E2E
 
- You don‚Äôt control the external system and can't mock it

## Black-box vs White-box Testing
These are two fundamental software testing methodologies based on what the tester knows about the internal system.


### Black-box Testing:
Black-box Testing tests a system from the outside ‚Äî without any knowledge of its internal logic or code.
-  The tester doesn‚Äôt care how the code works, only what it does.

### Key Features: Black-box Testing

| Feature               | Black-box Testing                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Access to source code | ‚ùå No                                     |
| Who does it?          | QA testers, end users                    |
| What is tested?       | Inputs and outputs (behavior)            |
| Speed                 | üê¢ Slower (more exploratory/manual)       |
| Reliability           | ‚úÖ High (covers real usage)              |

###  What Can You Test?

| Area                | Example                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Functional correctness | Does `login()` return a token on success?   |
| UI behavior          | Does clicking ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù create a post?        |
| API endpoints        | Does `POST /users` create a new user?        |
| Error handling       | Does app show error on bad input?            |
| Edge cases           | What if user enters no password?             |

### Techniques Used:

| Technique               | What it means                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Equivalence partitioning | Test input groups (valid vs invalid ranges)         |
| Boundary value analysis  | Test edges like 0, 1, `MAX_INT`                      |
| Decision table testing   | Test all combinations of inputs/decisions           |
| State transition testing | Test states: logged-in ‚Üí logged-out                |
| Error guessing           | Try likely failure scenarios (bad input)           |

 ### White-box Testing
White-box Testing (aka clear box, glass box, structural testing) tests the internal logic, code, and structure of the system.
- The tester knows everything about the code, including flow, logic, and structure.

### Key Features:

| Feature              | White-box Testing                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Access to source code| ‚úÖ Yes                                         |
| Who does it?         | Developers or test engineers                  |
| What is tested?      | Logic branches, paths, loops                  |
| Speed                | ‚ö° Very fast (automated usually)              |
| Reliability          | ‚úÖ Great for internal bugs                    |


###  What Can You Test?

| Test Target      | Example                                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Logic branches    | Does `if-else` behave as expected?                 |
| Conditions        | Is `if (a && b)` tested for all values?            |
| Loops             | Are edge cases in loops covered?                   |
| Function coverage | Is every function tested?                          |
| Internal errors   | Are exceptions handled correctly?                  |


###  Techniques Used:

| Technique           | What it covers                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statement coverage  | Has every line run at least once?                              |
| Branch coverage     | Has each `if/else` branch run?                                 |
| Path coverage       | Have all possible execution paths run?                         |
| Condition coverage  | Have all boolean conditions been tested?                       |
| MC/DC               | Every condition independently affects output (used in aviation, etc.) |

## Black-box vs White-box Testing: Comparison

| Feature           | Black-box            | White-box                 |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Knowledge of code | ‚ùå Not required       | ‚úÖ Required                |
| Tested by         | QA, testers          | Developers, SDETs          |
| Scope             | External behavior     | Internal structure         |
| Tools             | Selenium, Postman     | Jest, JUnit, Pytest        |
| Speed             | üê¢ Slower             | ‚ö° Faster                  |
| Bugs found        | UI, API, logic flow   | Code logic, paths     

### When to Use Which?

| Use Case                               | Recommended Testing           |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Testing public APIs or UI              | ‚úÖ Black-box                  |
| Testing a login route behavior         | ‚úÖ Black-box + Integration    |
| Testing backend auth logic             | ‚úÖ White-box                  |
| Validating loops, paths, edge logic    | ‚úÖ White-box                  |
| Full user flow (e.g., signup ‚Üí email)  | ‚úÖ Black-box                  |

### Summary

| Aspect              | Black-box                   | White-box                   |

| View                | Outside-in                  | Inside-out                  |
| Ideal for           | User behavior, APIs         | Logic, code correctness     |
| Who writes it       | QA testers                  | Developers                  |
| Test type examples  | UI test, API test           | Unit test, path coverage    |

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing
E2E Testing simulates how a real user interacts with your application from start to finish.
It verifies that all integrated pieces of the system (frontend, backend, DB, APIs, auth, etc.) work together correctly.

- E2E = Entire user journey is tested. Think: ‚ÄúFrom login ‚ûù checkout ‚ûù order confirmation‚Äù

### What Does E2E Test
| Area            | Example                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication  | Can a user register and then log in?                                  |
| UI interaction  | Does clicking a button open a modal?                                  |
| Navigation      | Can the user go from homepage ‚ûù cart ‚ûù checkout?                      |
| Full workflows  | Can user add items to cart, checkout, and get a confirmation message? |
| Error handling  | Does an invalid email show the correct error message?                 |
| 3rd-party flows | Can the user complete a Stripe or Google OAuth login?                 |

### E2E vs Unit vs Integration

| Feature        | Unit Test             | Integration Test                 | E2E Test                        |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Scope          | One function/module   | Multiple modules                 | Full system                     |
| Speed          | ‚ö° Super fast          | ‚ö° Medium                         | üê¢ Slow                         |
| Setup          | Minimal               | DB or mocks                      | Full app + DB + browser         |
| Example        | `add(2, 3)` returns 5 | API connects to DB               | User logs in and sees dashboard |
| Breakage cause | Logic bug             | Miscommunication between modules | UI/API/network issue            |

### Pros:
| Benefit                    | Why it matters                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Real user simulation     | Tests what really matters                    |
| ‚úÖ Prevents regression bugs | Catch bugs caused by UI/backend updates      |
| ‚úÖ Cross-system coverage    | Tests frontend, backend, DB, auth, etc.      |
| ‚úÖ Business flow validation | Ensures real workflows (e.g., checkout) work |
### Cons 
| Drawback               | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| üê¢ Slow                | UI, network, and DB make it slower            |
| ‚ùå Flaky                | Minor delays or race conditions can fail test |
| üí∏ Costly              | Setup, maintenance, CI execution time         |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging is harder | Failures can be vague (‚Äúbutton not found‚Äù)    |

### Best Practices

| Tip                              | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß™ Test critical user flows only | Don‚Äôt test every button ‚Äî focus on core workflows                 |
| ‚ö° Use data resets                | Clean DB or use mock/stubbed data before each test                |
| üßº Isolate from real systems     | Use test environments, test DBs, and avoid production APIs        |
| ‚è±Ô∏è Wait intelligently            | Use explicit waits (`cy.wait()`, `await`) instead of fixed delays |
| üì¶ Run on CI/CD                  | Integrate with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.           |
| üßØ Screenshot/video on fail      | Helps debugging in CI (Cypress/Playwright do this well)           |
### Example

describe('User Signup Flow', () => {
  it('should sign up and redirect to dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/signup');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('hyxal@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('securepass123');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.contains('Welcome, Hyxal');
  });
